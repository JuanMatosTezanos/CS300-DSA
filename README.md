What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This course covered various data models, including binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, and explored their proper use in applications.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I focused on understanding the different data structures  and how they work under the hood. Data structures are 
important because they help organize and store data efficiently, making it easier to access, modify, and manage. By knowing when and how 
to use the right data structure, you can improve the performance of your application, whether it's speed, memory usage, or simplicity. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame any roadbocks by looking at examples, tutorials and documentaiton on how the certain structure or algorithm is implemented.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has definitely expanded it in a positive way. For example, back then, if I wanted to find values in a vector, 
I would just brute-force it and use linear search, no matter how big the dataset was. But now, for example, 
if there are 20 values, linear search is better because it's small. However, if I have 1,000,000 values, 
a combination of quicksort and binary search would be the best solution. I can now choose the most efficient 
approach depending on the problem.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I've always used functions to keep my code organized, but Iâ€™ve never used one function to help another function perform a task. 
This approach has been really cool and a fun learning experience. I've also learned to apply data structure and algorithm (DSA) 
principles to make better decisions while coding, such as considering Big O notation to optimize the performance of my programs.
